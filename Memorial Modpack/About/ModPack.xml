            ---[What does this mod do?]---
            Rimworld is a rough, brutal game where a colony of people are doing whatever it takes to survive. Yeah it's rough, and sometimes it sucks, but at the end of the day, there are two kinds of people: Survivors, and hats.
                 
                  This mod completely overhauls the mood and opinions effects from to bring the mindsets of the colonists more in line with my idea of a Grim Reality where people understand that they don't have a choice but to be the strongest if they want to survive. Kill or be killed. Eat or be eaten. Hat or be hatted.
                       
                        ---[Details]---
                           This mod started as a few tweaks to fix issues in game that made no sense to me like how upset people got over tables or sleeping cold compared to how they reacted to more grave concerns for a colony of people who crashlanded and are trying to survive. I took inspiration from things like The Walking Dead, and other survival IPs where people are thrust into horrible circumstances and learn to cope very quickly. I formed the first version for A17, and "updated" it for B18 with quick syntax fixes. When it was time to start up a new game, I wanted to update it properly and get it pre-balanced for V1.0 release. But When I got into the code and started digging again... There was a lot more I wanted to change.
                                
                                 Some Examples of my Qualms with Vanilla:
                                      
                                       1. Cheating on someone gets you disliked by -70. 
                                          By contrast, selling someone's loved one to pirates get's you disliked by... -10.
                                             Tynan, who hurt you?
                                                  
                                                   2. Getting married gives you a 50 points mood boost!
                                                      But your wife getting shot gives you only a -25.
                                                         This means if someone shot your wife at your wedding, you'd get a net gain in happiness instead of... y'know... "The most tragic backstory ever" ala Wreck-it-Ralph ;)
                                                              
                                                               3. If you sleep in the cold, lack a table, and get hungry (not starving, just HUNGRY) you get enough net mood loss to be worse than your best friend dying. 
                                                                    
                                                                     4. Executing a guy who came into the colony and murdered literally your entire family... will still make you *sad* that he is executed. (Okay what, Tynan? What? Look at history, bro! People used to see Executions as ENTERTAINMENT! And when they think someone has it coming...)
                                                                          
                                                                           And the worst one...
                                                                                
                                                                                 5. Romance rebuffs. I don't even have to explain this one. If you've played... you hate them.
                                                                                      
                                                                                       I've overhauled the entire mood and opinions systems to balance all thoughts and situations better. The guiding design principle in this mod is largely based on the clannish nature of humans which fits from tribals who are well, tribal by nature, to advanced peoples who crashed down from the stars and now find themselves stuck in it together. The fact is that people tend to form up into groups. And killing, hurting, or harvesting MY person is worse than killing, hurting, or harvesting that guy who tried to kill my person. 
                                                                                            
                                                                                             People care more about their own kith and kin than they care about strangers. And even moreso, than they care about random assholes who try to hurt or kill their own. And when it comes down to it, a prisoner who killed their brother won't be missed if they die in their cell.
                                                                                                 
                                                                                                   People no longer hate ugly pawns beyond all reason. As my wifey said, "You're not going to hate the hideous surgeon that just saved your life and soloed the enemy raid to the point of punching him in his face just for how he looks!"
                                                                                                        
                                                                                                         Nor do they despise disfigurement to the point of assault and battery. Instead, scars are a mild positive because typically, they are received in battle as a result of protecting the colony! At the least, scars and disfigurement inspire a sense of pity in most people, rather than abject hatred. We've all seen way too many fist fights because someone was disfigured and a passerby just couldn't handle their face. In a survival scenario, presumably, people would put that shit aside and SURVIVE.
                                                                                                             
                                                                                                               Overall some of the "annoying" mood debuffs are either lessened, shortened, or both. But the bad ones...are worse.
                                                                                                                  This changes the balance of the game a bit, but I also lowered some of the "easy" positive boosts in value to compensate. Additionally, barracks are now USABLE. I just couldn't stand that people would rather sleep outside in the cold than sleep in a nice bedroom they had to share. Military does it. A lot of schools do it. Entire cultures do it for life with their whole family in a one room house. I don't buy that all people are so anti-sharing a bedroom that in a survival situation, they just couldn't or wouldn't suck it up and do the more reasonable thing to survive. Or even possibly find comfort in the proximity of others of their clan who would help them to survive.
                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                        I tweaked a lot of opinion changes in a similar vein. People are more bothered by horrific things and less by the little stuff. Cannibals are harder because generally most cultures find cannibals horrific. Organ harvesting, killing prisoners, etc. still gives a malus, but in most cases it's a boolean value. As in, everyone gets a negative for a while if you're selling prisoners to slavers, but it doesn't stack and it's not huge, so you can cope without having to wait until a wedding to butcher your prisoners! Your pawn who butchers enemies is no longer hated by everyone because the penalty no longer stacks to the sky. On the other hand, "I butchered humanlike..." DOES stack, and it's bad. So I'd advise using a Null Trait character for the job (Bloodlust, Cannibal, Psychopath) or be prepared to suffer the consequences if you still choose to engage in this behaviour that would rightly truly unsettle someone who lacked such traits. Overall, it may be simpler to keep your colony from descending into a Stupid Spiral of Stupid over minor annoyances, and more likely to Spiral over the sort of horrors that would reasonably drive a colony to their limits.
                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                              Personally, I love this change because it means the story is so much more meaningful to me. Don't get me wrong, I CHERISH my first game that ended in a massacre of my colonists by way of manhunter deer (lovingly dubbed "Deermurdered" in my heart and memory) and all the Fun I've encountered when my pyro whent on a burny streak because someone sat in his chair and the cute girl in maintenance shot him down again, even though he asked her three times two hours apart, and he got too tired to walk to the table and eat so he had to snack on his apple while *standing up* and he just couldn't even! *Rage face*... And that's part of the fun of Rimworld in a way. 
                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                    But when you're ready for a different kind of game where the story instead is gritty, realistic, serious, and sprinkled with Rimworld's little oddities (instead of riddled with them), this is an alternate style of play that may suit you. It's what I was longing for after a while, and I hope others will find it useful too.
                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                          So if you would like a Grim Reality where people care more about survival and less about whether or not they have a table to dine at or a super nice room, this is the mod for you. It will ensure that a colony that meets the survival needs is happier, and the extras are well... extra. It will ensure that people react more realistically to loss of loved ones, and the death of raiders who tried to kill them.
                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                And most importantly: It will fix all 5 of the Major Qualms listed above.
                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      One additional note: The mod now (as of the 1.0 release) also fixes psychopaths. They will no longer mind if other people and/or animals are killed, no matter how close they were, exactly as the "Psychopath" trait's description says. And they will no longer have their mood or their opinion of other people adjusted according to their romantic relationship status.
                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                            ---[Inspiration]---
                                                                                                                                                               Originally, the Greyer Morals mod, We Care Less About Prisoners, etc. Parts of the balancing inspired by Less Stupid Romance and Raw Crop Thoughts. This War is Mine and other survival games. The Walking Dead and other survival shows/movies. And most importantly: My wife's raging at the game over the "stupid" things her pawns were upset about compared to people dying etc. ;) Largely and mainly, the content of this mod is her idea. I'm just her code monkey!
                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                     Disclaimer: I'm not saying this is the best or perfect way to play. I just wanted the values rebalanced, and this is my preferred way to play. If you feel it is too, I'd love if you rate this mod up! Thank you!
                                                                                                                                                                        Also, from the wifey who did most of the balancing: "It's not perfectly balanced...but I tried. And let's be honest, neither was vanilla. :] But I tried to make it a little less...silly, imo."

Complete overhaul of the entire mood and opinions system. Every value was either changed or rebalanced around. MOST values changed. Some flavor text re-written. 100% B18 update, and readied for 1.0 release (will need to adjust for any syntax changes but this is the mod's "final form").

            Vanilla Expanded Framework incorporates a multitude of functionalities for different mods in order for us to boost performance by not duplicating code across several mods. Examples of shared functionality include custom base generation code with an amazing building export tool, customisable sieges, faction-based pack animal textures, faction based apparel colouring system, Orion’s Faction Discovery revamped and improved, Item processor code, shields, and many, many others.
            	
               	Orion's Faction Discovery?
                  
                     Yes!We have negotiated a deal with Orion and included his Faction Discovery mod within Vanilla Expanded Framework. Now, if you decide to add a faction to an existing playthrough, upon loading up the save you will have an option to spawn it's settlements and define how many of them you would like to spawn, as well as how far away from the player.

            Vanilla Cooking Expanded is a core module in a brand new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team, notably Sarg Bjornson, Oskar Potocki and Chowder. Whilst other mods work very well without it, Vanilla Cooking Expanded makes use of fish from Vanilla Fishing Expanded as well as plants from Vanilla Plants Expanded in order to provide users with a more in-depth cooking experience.
            
               Mechanics are simple and intuitive - keeping within the vanilla spirit without the unnecessary fluff and production chains. Your colonists will be able to cook up a variety of new meal types, make mood boosting desserts out of fruits, make filling grilled meals that lose the effect when frozen, create large bakes using flour or produce large quantities of soup through boiling ingredients for several days at a time. Using our new system, you can now transform animal milk into cheese inside a cheese press - and it gains quality, and with that - value, the longer it’s inside! Yes, alongside Vanilla Factions Expanded - Medieval you can now create a cheese and wine empire! Hopefully this will provide one more reason to keep livestock!
                  
                     Our systems are heavily moddable and support a variety of pre-existing mods. With Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids you can now transform insectoid milk into insectoid cheese, and thanks to Sarg Bjornson, you can now utilise 19 (!) types of milk from Alpha Animals, Genetic Rim (plus patches), RimBees and Forsakens: Fauna to create your cheese empire!
                        
                           New ways of preserving food in the form of canning and deep frying, as well as a brand new condiment system will allow you to create not-so-filling gourmet meals that apply long term effects to people who consume them.

            Vanilla Ideology Expanded is a mini-series of mods aimed at expanding the content in ideology - be it memes, relics and symbols or icons alike.
            	
               The goal of the Memes and Structures mod is to add unique memes, and… well, structures to your game. For some reason certain obvious choices like Shinto, Taoism and Eldritch were missing from the base DLC, and this mod is here to introduce them to the ideology creation.
                  With unique memes, players will be able to diversify their playthrough every time they play. This should increase longevity of the game and also make it way more unique and personalised.
                     
                        This mod adds 36 new memes, alongside many new structures, rituals, precepts, specialist roles, items, objects and mechanics. It should greatly expand what Ideology has to offer, and meshes nicely with the rest of the DLC. With Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Memes and Structures you will be able to create powerful psykers that simply love chocolate, a corporate scrap trading business, a fishing republic, a bunch of god-king radicals, mechanoid technocratic union and much, much more.

            Adds extra functionality to the Animals tab 
            
               &amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Important&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
                  Does not require a new save game. 
                     Can safely be enabled/disabled in ongoing saves. 
                        
                           &amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Notes&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
                              First released back in A12 (or was it 11?) this mod vastly improved the vanilla animals tab. Evidently, Tynan agreed and the mod is now (mostly) part of the vanilla game. I still feel this mod looks better, and adds enough extra functionality (sorting, filters, renaming) to make it a worthwhile replacement. 
                                 
                                    &amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Known Issues&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
                                       Domestication (wildness) and the loss over training over time is not visible in the tab. I plan on adding some kind of indicator to show this, but don’t know when I’ll have time. Note that this information is also not shown in the vanilla animals tab.

                                                Gender and lifestage icons on the animals tab. Easily keep track of your chickenfarm! 
                                                   Butchery designation right from the animals tab. 
                                                      Sort by name, gender, lifestage/age, and bodysize (meat). 
                                                         Filter by race, and a variety of attributes. 
                                                            Rename (named) pets. Don’t like the name Buttercup for your Warg? Change it!

            Main button icons for mods that lack them, or otherwise look out of place. Just like the other two expansion mods for Vanilla Textures Expanded, except with a few more icons, slightly better compatibility and a different style once again.
            
               This isn't related to Vanilla Textures Expanded anyway, but that mod adds icons to vanilla buttons, and this is meant to fill the gap VTE leaves for mod icons. The preview image includes some of their icons.

            Vanilla Textures Expanded is a full-scale overhaul of vanilla (unmodded) RimWorld textures, with its main aim being not only to fix less aesthetically pleasing textures, but also to bring vanilla aesthetic in-line with that of Vanilla Expanded mod series.
            
               This texture pack includes over 450 textures remade in vector-based software (same method used for Vanilla Expanded mods), exported into 2x the size of vanilla textures. What used to be blurred before, now will be sharp and crisp, even if zoomed in fully using mods by the likes of Camera+.
                  
                     When redrawing vanilla textures, our main focus was on keeping them consistent with what players are used to - don’t expect any drastic design changes - we have only changed the look of things that were really bad or ambiguous.
                        
                           We plan to keep adding new textures in the future, so make sure to let us know what particular textures in vanilla game require changes!

            Ever wondered if animals really should all have the same shades?
              I sure did, so I utilized the assembly from Animal Collab Project to give vanilla animals a bit of variation. The assembly was created by thirite and has been updated by Xen.
                 Now in collaboration with Azrael!
                    Note that this will conflict with any mod that overrides these animals' textures. If Vanilla Textures Expanded, please load Variety Coats AFTER that. The Autosort function will do that for you!

            This is an update of -210's mod with their approval.
               https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1409440925
                  
                     Added four new spots:
                        	- Milking
                           	- Shearing
                              	- Slaughtering
                                 	- Training
                                    
                                       Icons from https://www.flaticon.com/

                                                Pawns will select the nearest spot valid for the action they want to do.
                                                   The old animal harvesting spot can be used for all but training.
                                                      
                                                         There is also an alternate texture-mod made by Si-Cafe:

            Removes the (arbitrary) limit to the number of areas you can create, change area colours.
            
               &amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Notes&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
                  While this completely removes the limit on the number of areas you can create, the area selection widget in other parts of the UI is untouched - and designed for 5 areas per type. If you create too many areas, you may run into issues. This practical limit depends largely on your resolution and UI size factor. I have no plans to update these UI issues, nor could I do so for all the mods that use areas.

            Enchances pawns' perception of nature.
            
               Simple mod that adjusts beauty and ugly modifiers for terrain and flora. Most notable changes:
                  
                     - flowers are significantly more beautiful now;
                        - most trees have beauty increased to 2-4 range. Oak and Teak trees have 5 beauty;
                           - grass and most bush plants have 1 beauty. Berry plants and healroot have 2 beauty;
                              - water has overall beauty increased to 4 with ocean cost line having beauty of 6;
                                 - soil, sand and ice get neutral beauty, rich soil gets 1 beauty;
                                    - mud and marsh are really dislikable for the pawns now (-4 and -6 beauty);
                                       - rafflesia is adjusted to -12 beauty to correspond its description;
                                          - chunks and stone blocks are more tolerable with -4 and -6 beauty (against -8 and -12 in Vanilla. Ouch!).

            Vanilla Apparel Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Weapons Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.
            
               Apparel is distributed into several new technologies that need to be researched, expanding the life of the game and possibly leading to some interesting choices - research a way to get off this planet? Or maybe learn how to craft jeans and workwear?
                  
                     This mod adds a wide selection of apparel with useful effects, including but not limited to:
                        Gas masks protecting from toxicity;
                           Jumpsuits and aprons for work speed boost;
                              Doctor scrubs and Chef’s uniforms.

            Vanilla Apparel Expanded - Accessories is a new installment in the Vanilla Expanded series. This time, our sight fell onto the accessories system, which is quite heavily limited in vanilla game. Smokepop belt, or Shield belt - these are your only choices. Are you rich enough to sport Royalty in your game? You MIGHT be able to build jet packs too! And Broadshield generators.
            
               Again, limited, isn’t it? Hence, we have decided it’s time to spice things up, and add some new equipment items for all technological eras of Rimworld - but as you all know, simply ‘adding X to Y skill’ isn’t the usual way we pick - therefor we tried to keep the bonuses and utility applications as varied as possible.
                  
                     Your tribal archers will now be twice as efficient with quivers, while your construction crews will carry belts with tools to speed up work. Your military commandos might find themselves a new shoulder mounted friend, and if you’re lucky and ballsy enough to do quests, a resurrector belt will literally stop your pawn from dying.

            Vanilla Brewing Expanded is an alcohol-oriented module in “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team, notably Sarg Bjornson, Oskar Potocki and Chowder. Whilst other mods such as Vanilla Plants Expanded and Vanilla Fishing Expanded work well as standalone, due to technical limitations Vanilla Brewing Expanded requires the Core cooking mod.
            
               We made sure to keep the mechanics of this mod simple and intuitive without ruining the spirit of vanilla gameplay. All elements of this mod offer unique advantages and disadvantages, enhancing the depth of the game a thousandfold. With 7 unique, new alcohol types, you can now tailor your colonists’ drinking habits to your liking, with each alcohol having a unique production chain, buffs, downsides and uses.
                  
                     We strive to add unique elements for every single one of our players. A widely requested feature - tea and coffee, has also been added, allowing you to brew an immunity boosting hot tea, or whip out hot and iced coffees that help with staying awake and provide help against hypothermia and heat stroke respectively. Cigarettes and cigars also make an appearance, very addictive but incredibly helpful in stressful situations.

            After a long delay, our brand new Vanilla Factions Expanded module is now ready. Insectoids feature a diversified, new, unplayable faction that will populate the world with insects and monstrosities your colonists never dreamt of. Led by an Ancient Insectoid queen, these eusocial creatures can be heard chittering underground, with outposts and villages across the surface mysteriously disappearing overnight.
            
               Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids allows you to take a fight to the insects. No longer such an interesting faction will be limited to one ingame event only. Insectoids now possess bases on the surface - in the form of overrun outposts filled with riches and hives for you to purge.
                  
                     They will now be allowed to raid, the same way as mechanoids or other factions can. They won’t engage in diplomacy and they won’t give you quests - as they are forever hostile. This mod features a number of new insectoids filling various niches whilst still keeping the feel of the faction the same as in vanilla - melee only, relying on swarming their opponents.
                        
                           For those brave enough to harness their power, bio-engineering is now a thing. Obtained from traders and quest rewards only, players can now vat-grow over 20 unique insectoids, obeying their every command and performing tasks around the base.
                              
                                 Genomes used in bio-engineering can also be implanted in colonists and prisoners alike, leading to various genetic mutations - some good, some bad.
                                    
                                       New riot gear is craftable and ready to be used by your base security whilst new quest-reward only plasma weapons will allow you to get rid of the insectoids even more effectively.
                                          
                                             Mercenaries starting scenario pits you in the battle against the insectoids at the very beginning, placing you on the outskirts of an overrun outpost. Can you clear it out with your superior weaponry and call it home? Or will you evacuate the area and find a new settlement?

            Deep Storage Units: yet another storage solution
            
               LWM presents a way to organize your supplies, loot, clothes, and even your garbage, to allow you a tidy base where your colonists aren't simply dumping stuff on the floor.  Deep Storage units include medicine cabinets, meat hooks, clothing racks, weapon lockers, etc, and all can store diverse items - just like regular shelves, but they allow more than one thing!
                  
                     ADDON MODS:
                         * Note: I have not used these, and have been super busy so haven't had a chance to add anything to the base mod. If you find right-clicking on storage slow, you might try this:
                            * A (faster?) UI for right-clicking on things: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169841018
                               * Little Storage 2, Vault, Simple Storage, etc - if you want more ways to store things, there are several available in the Steam workshop!
                                 
                                    FAQ / "I have a problem":
                                        * Meat Hooks require the Smithing research!
                                           * These Hampers are made of fabric, they don't hold fabric
                                              * Does it work with Vanilla shelves?
                                                 * You can always add more stored things in Mod Settings
                                                    ** (A little walkthrough for doing that: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2187075071)

                                                                * Have extra spending money?  Share a cup of something tasty (some places around here deliver!) at https://ko-fi.com/littlewhitemouse

                                                                            * Animals cannot by default haul to Storage - their little brains and paws (claws, etc) cannot manage the clasps, locks, catches, etc required to store things properly.(*)

                                                                                              * You can also change what's allowed in the Mod Settings!

            One of the first mods I ever came up with, and one that took the longest to design, draw, code and deliver, Vanilla Factions Expanded - Mechanoids is a mod unlike any other. A group of talented modders came together to make sure this mod is not only full of new interesting content, but also provides something to make the game a bit more dynamic.
            
               We have improved on the Custom Settlement Generation code to provide you with semi-random spaceships that Mechanoids can use to wreak havoc on the planet’s surface. Thanks to a lot of cooperation from some of the most famous modders out there, we were able to provide you with not just a new faction, but a unique mechanic of Total War, which makes the faction stronger the more ships land on the planet. We were also able to give you a little Factorio love letter in the form of fully automated machines that produce various items in the game, automatically. Did I mention it’s all happening automatically?
                  
                     New buildable mechanoids can fill various roles around your colony, from cleaning and hauling to base defense. With supercomputers, you can now automate research, Autosowers and Autoharvesters on the other hand will allow you to begin your farming enterprise with no need for physical labor.
                        
                           New quests, new events, new starting scenario, a storyteller, it’s all waiting for you. Merry Christmas!

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Art module is something long overdue. Being an artist, I struggled to comprehend why the only type of sculptures we can make are small, large or grand artworks on a tiny pedestal. It made Artistic skill pretty much undesirable. Come on, how many times have you said to yourself “Oh crikey, that’s another pawn that can only do art”? 
            
               A lot of people requested this mod on my Patreon so it’s about time I deliver. With this mod, your colony can create simple pottery from neolithic times, allowing you to gain some silver on the side to kickstart your base into the medieval era. Several new pieces of sculptures are available by the likes of small, large and grand statues, wall reliefs, decorative pillars and plinths that act both as an artwork and a shelf.
                  
                     With industrial era your colony will be able to produce beautiful embroidered rugs to decorate those ugly floors! A new type of wall - wallpaper - is now also available, allowing you to put some colour onto your grim, broken walls. Spacer era features a new type of art called a hologram, emitting beautiful shade of blue light and using intellectual skill to determine the quality of it - however it does use up power!
                        
                           And if that isn’t enough, a new type of quest reward is available - Archotech sculptures, not only being extremely beautiful and desirable, but also imprinting stunning imagery in the minds of surrounding colonists!

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Production module, is an ideal mod to fill that late game hole in production. Once you set up your vanilla workstations with tool cabinets scattered everywhere, you essentially got as far as you possibly can. This carefully designed, vanilla-fitting mod adds a new layer to workstation layout, hopefully allowing players to create manufacturing-designated rooms instead of one massive room with all the workbenches.
            
               Linkables:
                  - Kitchen Sink Cabinet
                     - Tailor Cabinet
                        - Smithy Cabinet
                           - Machining Cabinet

                                                - Electric Butcher

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Security module is a result of hours upon hours of hard work. It has been a long time since we began working on this mod, and with a team of brilliant programmers, I am not honored to present to you a Vanilla Expanded approach to base defenses. Every word and every stat in this mod have been carefully prepared to be as balanced and as “vanilla” as possible. 
            
               This module introduces 27 new defense structures, all neatly filling up the Security tab in the Architect menu. With research technologies spread out across all stages of the game, this mod itself is enough to provide you with hours of entertainment.

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.
            
               Weapons are spread across the technology tree allowing for realistic and time-consuming progression, making the higher-tech weapons even more rewarding. Bear in mind, however, that all weapons are perfectly balanced in line with Vanilla weapons, which means that a Battle Rifle added by this mod might not necessarily be better than a standard assault rifle in some situations.

            this mod provides a new GUI Window for the Mod mismatch window instead of default CUI one.
               including version mismatch checking.
                  
                     this mod uses Manifest.xml for version checking, introduced by Fluffy's Mod manager.
                        if you're a developer and you want to add version support, please add version in Manifest.xml !
                           		
                              check Fluffy's Mod manager Github page for detailed description.

            Construction will use things in your colonist or pack animal's inventory.
            
               Fork changes logic for this to be more aggressive about finding items available on the pawn doing the delivery. Edge cases remain where item behavior is weird, but only when doing many actions while game is paused and cannot recache information.
                  
                     Original version credit to Uuugggg, whose original version can be found here if needing support for older versions: https://steamcommunity.com/id/Uuugggg/myworkshopfiles/?appid=294100
                        
                           A 1.2 compatible build of this fork may be provided in the near future.

            Color code each pawn's mood bar within the colonist bar based on their current mood.\n\nRed: extreme mental break threshold\nOrange: major mental break threshold\nYellow: minor mental break threshold\nGray: neutral mood\nLight Blue: content\nGreen: happy\n\nAlso includes:\n\nBreak Box, an outline to highlight when the colonist is in a break mood, useful for "larger" colonists (default on). This can be drawn beneath or on top of the colonist to further highlight the colonist (default beneath).\nSchedule Box, an outline to show the colonists current schedule (default off).\nIllness Icon, an icon that is displayed when the colonist has an illness that requires immunity (default on).\nBleeding Icon, an icon that is displayed when the colonist is bleeding with 3 different sizes based on bleed rate, Large lt 8 hours until death, Medium lt 24 hours, Small gt 24 hours (default on).\nThermal Icons, icons for when colonists are suffereing hypotherma/heatstroke (minor and above).\n\nUpdates:\n\nPorqueNoLosDos:\n24-09-2017: Removed unnecessary error log messages.\n18-11-2017: Updated for RimWord version 0.18.1722, and added content and happy mood colors.\n04-05-2019: Updated for RimWorld version 1.0.2231.\n\nCrashM:\n24-02-2020: Updated for RimWorld version 1.1 (1.1 only, won't work on 1.0), and made it better reflect break thresholds.\n27-02-2020: Added outline box for break risks as previously extreme had such a small bar it was usually not visible.\n29-02-2020: Added Mod Settings to allow changing the color of each threshold and disable the mental break outline box if needed.\n01-03-2020: Fixed memory leak.\n04-04-2020: Added option to put the break box on top of the colonist (default off) so it is more visible for the larger colonists.\n15-06-2020: Added optional neutral break box (default off).\n28-07-2020: Added Optional Schedule Box to show colonists current schedule.\n04-09-2020: Added optional illness icon for illnesses that require immunity.\n05-09-2020: Added optional bleeding icon with 3 sizes based on bleed rate.\n15-09-2020: Performance updates and caching. I have improved performance by an average of 25% over the previous version (test has 20 colonists, same settings), I also removed the schedule box for when colonists are on the Anything schedule as this also helps performance. There is also a new Refresh Rate setting where you can decide how often the cache is refreshed (150ms seems more than enough for 20 colonists, 0 disables the cache).\n23-09-2020: More performance improvements. Please note, the performance improvement has made the cache mandatory, if this causes problems please let me know.\n27-09-2020: Bug Fix (error when enabling schedule box when in game), Added optional ability to hide portraits (helps performance).\n27-09-2020: Bug Fix.\n01-10-2020: Extended the allowed caching to 2s, and made the selection highlighting uncached.\n24-10-2020: More performance improvements (removed some reflection).\n25-10-2020: Bug Fix + Another performance improvement that make it faster than vanilla.\n25-10-2020: Bug Fix + Minor performance improvments + the bleeding icon now flashes when lt 3 hours + the illness icon will flash when severity gt immunity and severity gt 80% + the illness icon will turn yellow when immunity gt severity + the illness icon will turn green when immunity gt %5 more than severity.\n20-12-2020: Bug fix + An optional (disabled by default) alternative label that is faster but may have bugs + Thermal warning icons (colors customisable in the settings).\n27-03-2021: Added proper tooltips to the settings.\n06-04-2021: Additional Performance Improvment when enabling the Alternative Label in the settings.\n09-04-2021: Bug Fix\n23-04-2021: Added an option to force a portrait update when colonists drafted status changes (as requested by Deco)\n05-07-2021: 1.3 Compatibility\n07-07-2021: Fixed Problem with RW1.2 loading the 1.3 dll.\n23-07-2021: Ideology Update\n24-07-2021: Fixed Settings\n28-07-2021: 1.3.3074.1: Added a Version Number to help prevent issues with old versions being used. It will be included in the initialisation message in the games log and the mod settings.\n15-08-2021: 1.3.3087.1: Fixed compatibility issue with QEE by Mario55770\n18-08-2021: 1.3.3094.1: Added Compatability with Colony Groups, please note this is a work in progress so some things might be weird or broken.\n20-08-2021: 1.3.3096.1: Bug Fix\n25-08-2021: 1.3.3102.1: Fixed thermal icon still showing after death.\n16-09-2021: 1.3.3117.1: Additional compatibility with Colony Groups (fixed issues with pawn/box sizes).\n18-09-2021: 1.3.3117.2: Added optional Gender icon.\n18-09-2021: 1.3.3136.1: Added optional Cryptosleep Icon

               Lets you modify the commonality of biomes at world-generation.
                  Should work on all biomes, vanilla and modded.
                     
                        Biome Commonality = how common each biome is.

                        - Added correct reservation of filth so pawns dont clean the same filth
                           - Pawns that is not allowed in a higher priority cleaning zone should now clean filth in lower priority zones instead of not cleaning at all

                                                                                                      [b]Priority Cleaning:[/b] You can make colonists clean filth in an important area before cleaning another lower priority areas that you can assign. If you make an allowed area covering your hospital and set it to the highest priority (using the menu you can open by clicking the broom icon on the bottom right of your screen) colonists will clean the hospital first before cleaning anything else.

You can even remove the home area and add in another custom area and your colonists will stop cleaning the home area and instead clean according to your set priority list.
                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                  [b]Works fine if you don't care about priority:[/b] The first cleaning area by default will be the home area, so if you don't touch the priority list at all when playing on a map, colonists will clean like usual.
                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                        [b]Additional Notes:[/b]
                                                                                                                           There is bit of delay between the current cleaning area updating and new filth being spawned. This is because, like vanilla, colonists won't clean new dirt (must be 600 ticks after the filth has last thickened).
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                 No original game methods have been detoured and the vanilla tracking of filth in the home area still works, so if any mods use this they should be fine. This mod may be incompatible with other cleaning mods. If you're not sure, try using them together and see if it works!
                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                       The mod will always force you to have at least one cleaning area. If you delete your last cleaning area the Home area will be added to the priority list.

However, don't be too scared, they probably won't corrupt your save and if you uninstall you will get a few errors that can be eliminated by overwriting your savegame. Your colonists will go back to cleaning the home area.

            Alters the health tab hediff listing to be slightly less ugly and slightly more customisable.
            
                &lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
                   
                     - Customisability
                        - Body part replacement names (ex: peg legs, archotech eyes, Pawnmorpher morphs) get folded into the body part's name
                           - Multiple icons for various severities of bleeding and tending quality
                              - Merging hediffs by type rather than by label, treated and untreated hediffs share same entry
                                 - One icon per wound instead of vanilla's averaged single icon
                                    - Sorting hediffs for body part by severity
                                       - Per-body part health bars
                                          - Severity/Immunity progress bars
                                             - Expandable health tab size (yes, I &lt;b&gt;am&lt;/b&gt; aware of the irony of a mod called Compact Hediffs making the tab &lt;i&gt;larger&lt;/i&gt;)

            Mix and match multiple 'tags' on a single pawn, allowing for composition of loadouts.
            
               &lt;size=24&gt;Features:&lt;/size&gt;
                  - Create tags containing items which a pawn will wear / pick up / equip automatically
                     - Create loadouts consisting of multiple tags for flexibility (composition)
                        - Create bills which make `x` number of items, where `x` is the number of pawns with the tag `y`
                           
                              &lt;size=24&gt;Mod Integrations:&lt;/size&gt;
                                 - Better Workbench Management: When copying a bill which targets a tag to another bill, copy the tag with it.
                                    - Pick up and Haul: Disable pick up patch from our side when PUAH is loaded (duplicate functionality).

                                             - Awesome Inventory: Both mods work in the same space, and will never be compatible. Sorry.
                                                - Combat Extended: This mod will be integrated into Combat Extended replacing their existing loadout system in the near (ish) future

                                                         - DrowsyCorgi ( NotooShabby ) for their incredible work on Awesome Inventory. I hope that it is visible the influence their mod has had; with regards to both the functionality of the mod, and the aesthetics of the GUI.  
                                                            - Madman666 for their work creating the custom textures which this mod uses
                                                               - All those who helped test, and gave feedback - it all helps

            Compressed Raid 1.3.1
            
               -About this mod-
                  This mod reduces the number of raiders in a single raid and enhances the raiders in proportion to the reduced number.
                     It meets the need of "I don't want to lose the fun of incremental difficulty, but I don't want to freeze my computer with too many raiders."
                        By default, the maximum number of raiders is 100, and the enhancement factor is modest.
                           If you feel that this is not enough, you can make more detailed settings in the mod settings.
                              And by the way, "Mechanoid cluster" is not supported.
                                 
                                    -Explanation of MOD setting items-
                                       The number of raiders participating in the raid, the enhancement factor, etc. can be set in detail.
                                          Please refer to the detail in mod page.

               Adds a prisoner-interaction to first convert prisoner and then recruit them.
                  When they get converted their interaction mode is automatically set to Recruit.
                     
                        Due to requests there is also an option to first reduce resistance before converting. 
                           This can be disabled in the options.

            Version: 1.11.0
            	
               &lt;size=20&gt;Description&lt;/size&gt;
                  Allows your colonists to remember their position during base defense. You can send off your colonists to their positions with a single click.
                     		
                        &lt;size=20&gt;How to use&lt;/size&gt;
                           &lt;b&gt;Set defensive positions for colonists&lt;/b&gt;
                              1) Draft your defenders and place them where you want them.
                                 2) With your defenders selected, right-click the Defensive position button and select "Save defensive position".
                                    Done. The selected colonists will remember their held positions.
                                       
                                          &lt;b&gt;Send colonists to saved positions&lt;/b&gt;
                                             1) Select your defenders.
                                                2) Click the Defensive position button (or press T).
                                                   Your defenders will be drafted and will run to their saved positions.
                                                      
                                                         &lt;b&gt;Advanced mode&lt;/b&gt;
                                                            Hold the Alt key and click the Defensive position button to switch between basic and advanced mode.
                                                               Advanced mode works exactly like Basic, but you have 4 positions to work with. Save a position using the right-click menu, then click the slot to send the selected colonists to the position they have been assigned under that number.
                                                                  Pressing T is the same as clicking the first slot.
                                                                     
                                                                        &lt;b&gt;Squad hotkeys&lt;/b&gt;
                                                                           Colonists can be assigned to squads for easier selection. To assign, hold the Ctrl key and press 1-9 on the numeric keypad to assign the squad to that key. Press the numeric key of a squad to select the squad members, press again to focus on the squad location.
                                                                              
                                                                                 &lt;b&gt;Utility hotkeys&lt;/b&gt;
                                                                                    There are three other keys on the keypad for quick colonist management: press period to select all colonists on the map, undraft everyone by pressing divide, and press zero to send all colonists to their assigned defensive position.
                                                                                       In the Options &gt; Mod Options window you can switch the Shift key from saving positions to queuing movement orders.

            Allows you to build, mine, zone, etc. in various shapes. First select the task you want to do (build, mine, zone), then go into the shapes menu and select the shape. Use the rotate keys to rotate the shape. Use the F key (or the key you have bound to "forbid item") to toggle filling of corners. There are settings you can adjust for flood-fill, the style of menu navigation, and even the ability to use the old UI.

               this MOD fixes a pandemic that has plagued many a world on the Rim: doors being wedged open. whether it's prisoners escaping, invaders rushing in, or temperature leaking out, unwanted open doors have led to disasters in many colonies. my MOD prevents items from being dropped on the same tile as a door, allowing it to close just as intended. after installing this MOD, please avoid placing stockpiles on the same tile as a door.

            Dear Users
            
                     Thank you using my Mods, Facial Animation has been patched by various modders.
                        I'm very happy about that. However, at the same time, it was becoming difficult to expand the functionality.
                     
                              So, I decided to split Facial Animation into two mods. This mod is for the human race.
                                 It contains only textures and definition files enabling new features.
                                    If you are interested in my textures and you want to trying new features, please activate this mod.
                                       I apologize for any inconvenience.
                                    
                                       
                                                Dear Modders
                                             
                                                      In order to release the new features of FacialAnimation faster, this mod has been separated from FacialAnimation.
                                                         Therefore, the new features implemented in this mod do not consider compatibility at all.
                                                            If you create a compatibility patch, it may not work properly depending on the future updates of this mod.
                                                         
                                                                  Caution
                                                                     Redistribution of this MOD data is prohibited.
                                                                  
                                                                           ユーザーの皆様へ
                                                                        
                                                                                 Facial Animationをいつもご利用いただきありがとうございます。
                                                                                    Facial Animationはこれまで様々なModderの方々によってパッチが作成されてきました。ありがとうございます。
                                                                                       しかしながら、同時に最近は互換性を考えると新機能の追加が難しいと感じてきています。
                                                                                    
                                                                                             そこで、私は表情Modを2つに分離することにしました。
                                                                                                新機能を試してみたい方は本Modを有効化してください。ご不便をおかけしますが宜しくお願い致します。
                                                                                             
                                                                                                      Modderの方々へ
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                            FacialAnimationの新機能を高速にリリースするため、本ModはFaicalAnimationから分離しました。
                                                                                                               したがって、本Modに組み込まれた新機能は互換性を重要視していません。
                                                                                                                  互換パッチを作成する場合、本Modの今後の更新によっては正常に動作しなくなる可能性があります。
                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                           注意
                                                                                                                              当MODの再配布を禁じます。

                     It comes built in options for Remove workbenches, Allow direct crafting, Direct crafting only and Legacy mode, so you no longer require the add-on modules if you have this active and simply use the mods settings to apply them.

                                 * The workbenches can link up with each other and the Fabrication workbench to improve production speed.
                                    * Patches for Cyber Fauna and Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Production to allow additional link ups.
                                       * Two new orbital ship traders: Prosthesis and Textile trader.
                                          * Ability to additionally harvest Stomach, Eye, Nose, Ear and Jaw body parts. Plays well with QEE.

                                                * Can heal scars and numerious chronic health conditions. Additional patch to work with Scar Removal Plus mod.
                                                   * Some prosthesis can be further upgraded.
                                                      * Body purist friendly augmentations in the form of Organic Optimizers and Instinct Optimizers.
                                                         * Ability to scrap unwanted prosthesis for materials.

                                                                       - Alien expansion + patcher, helps expand upon bionic content and certain issues with certain alien race mods.
                                                                        * The following add-on modules are built-in with using the XML Extension mod, but if you do not use that, then they are:

                                                                                      - Legacy mode, reverts crafting costs and methods to version 3.3.13 of the mod.
                                                                                       
                                                                                          Compared with original EPOE, this mod will see continued development and rebalancing, active bug fixes, and strives to follow vanilla's standard.

            This mod will enable you to :
            - Rename the AI factions and leaders.
               - Modify or load in new ideology
                  - Change faction relationships
                     - Change faction colour
                        - Change the names of settlements
                           - Relocate settlements (only works when starting a new game)
                              
                                 Please note that this is my first mod for this game (or any game really). So it's quite likely a bit rough and I'm not sure if it'll work for any other language than English.
                                    
                                       If you'd like to further customize your factions (change their apperance, loadout, and more) I'd recommend this mod:
                                          
                                             Total Control
                                                
                                                   Update: I'm unsure of the consequences of changing faction ideology or their relationships. So use with care and not for a game you're serious with, at least not until this has been tested enough.

            Updated 7/11/21 by Jamaican Castle
            
               =====
                  
                     Fertile Fields is now 1.2 compatible! The name remains unchanged because otherwise everyone's FindMod patches would have to change and nobody wants that.
                        
                           Fertile Fields allows you to transform and improve your colony's terrain, harvest raw materials from the land, and use them to enhance your environment.
                              
                                 - New in 1.1 -
                                    
                                       Multi-terraforming tools, distinguished by the red ? icon, allow you to terraform multiple existing terrains to a single terrain of your choice with one designation. If it takes more than one step to go from the existing terrain to your chosen terrain, additional steps will be queued up for your colonists to work on.
                                          
                                             Plant scraps have been rebalanced and made less obtrusive. Yields of plant scraps from many plants have been decreased, especially crops with low yields and decorative plants. Plants harvested in the wild or from hydroponics also have 50% lower plant scrap yields. A new fueled generator has been added that consumes 75 plant scraps per day for 1000W of power.
                                                
                                                   Growing zones have two new toggleable options: return to soil and automatically redesignate. The first option causes plants harvested there to not drop plant scraps, but to deplete soil less often. (This is generally less efficient than harvesting the scraps and refertilizing, but saves a lot of labor and storage space.) The second option triggers automatic rebuilding of any soil that depletes.
                                                      
                                                         All terraforming-related resources (including plant scraps) now stack to 200. Fertilizer is less valuable when sold to caravans.
                                                            
                                                               Terrains that share an affordance type with a basic terrain (such as soft sand for sand) can be transformed directly into that type. This mostly affects mod-added terrain.
                                                                  
                                                                     =====
                                                                        
                                                                           Terraforming
                                                                              
                                                                                 The Terraforming tab of the architect menu allows you to modify terrain to suit the needs of your colony. Transforming tiles to less fertile or useful terrain will generally yield resources such as sand, dirt, clay, or rock. Transforming tiles to more fertile terrain requires resources.
                                                                                    
                                                                                       Multi-terraformers, shown with a red ? icon, will transform any terrain underneath them into the selected terrain. This may take multiple steps; if so, extra steps are built automatically after the first one is completed.
                                                                                          
                                                                                             If you right-click on a multi-terraformer, you can select a single terraformer that will transform only one specific type of terrain into the selected terrain. More information about each transformation can be found in its single terraformer's description.
                                                                                                
                                                                                                   The Terraforming technology unlocks the ability to perform more sweeping modifications of terrain: removing shallow water and marsh, transforming deep water into shallow water (or vice versa), and placing or breaking up solid stone terrain.

Compost bins and barrels allow you to transform raw compost, created at the butcher's table, into fertilizer that can transform regular soil into rich soil.
                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                           The Farming technology expands your options by allowing you to place dirt on smooth stone or ice terrain to form topsoil, which can be fertilized. Rich soil, meanwhile, can be tilled for an even greater improvement in productivity.
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                 Fertile soil used in a growing zone will eventually degrade into less fertile soil. You can use excess plant material to mitigate this, or harvest these plant scraps to make fertilizer, as animal feed, or to fuel generators.

In addition to being dug up, these clay can be ground from dirt or sand (and sand from rocks) at a stonecutter's table.

            Adds 27 landforms to the game, which generate biome-independently and appear as "special features" in the info tab of the world map. The goal of this mod is to make map generation more interesting and varied, compared to the vanilla experience of simply having either a cliff or a coast on one edge of your map.

            Allows grass and brambles to grow under roofs. This is intended to be used alongside mods that add transparent roofs, all this does is allow grass to naturally respawn even if it's under a roof

            "Fire at will" defaults to disabled when pawns are drafted if they are equipped with grenades or launchers.
            
               These vanilla weapons are affected by this mod:
                  - Frag grenades
                     - EMP grenades
                        - Molotov cocktails
                           - Smoke launcher
                              - Incendiary launcher
                                 - EMP launcher
                                    - Doomsday rocket launcher
                                       - Triple rocket launcher
                                          
                                             Modded weapons whose projectile creates some kind of AoE explosion should also work.

MapComponents are saved along with your savegame, so uninstalling and loading a save where this mod is used will give you an error. However, this error is easily eliminated by overwriting your savefile without the mod loaded, which won't corrupt your savefile or do anything bad.

If you're impatient and the counts don't look correct, just advance time faster and it should update sooner.

            Ideology Development+ overhauls reforming of fluid ideoligions.
            	
               A reform now requires varying amount of development points, determined by what you change. The cost consists of the following parts:
                  
                     - Base reform cost, which increases with every reform until it reaches a ceiling. By default, it goes from 10 to 20 dev points.
                        
                           - Cost of added and removed memes, scaled with their impact (2 to 6 points). Structure and style are free.
                              
                                 - Changing precepts costs normally 1 point per precept, but it increases for spectrum-like precepts (such as number of spouses) when you want to jump several steps at a time (e.g. from having 1 spouse to having 4).
                                    
                                       - Adding or removing certain precepts that have a serious gameplay impact may cost or reimburse dev points. E.g. adopting Very Fast Research will cost you 4 more points; adopting Very Slow Research will give you 4 dev points.
                                          
                                             Notes:
                                                
                                                   - Acquisition of development points is doubled (by default). So when the game says you will receive 2 dev points for a ritual, you will actually get 4, and so on.
                                                      
                                                         - Dev point cap is removed (i.e. you can accumulate as many dev points as you want)
                                                            
                                                               - In Surprise Precepts Mode (enable in mod settings), you only choose memes (and also culture) and precepts are randomly auto-generated. You can't preview or change them, but they are free
                                                                  
                                                                     - Can be added to an ongoing game, even if your ideoligion is not fluid (you will be offered to make it such). Removing it mid-game will cause a one-time harmless error message
                                                                        
                                                                           - Most values can be tweaked to your liking
                                                                              
                                                                                 Obviously, Ideology DLC is required. So is Harmony.

            Caves is one of the biomes we have never covered or even considered covering before, but here we are! With this mod, you can tame powerful cave bears, collect colorful blind salamanders, run away from insectoid hulks, bond with incredibly agile and dangerous wyrms, get poisoned by cave crawlers or discover giant spider nests!
            
               This mod supports the Arachnophobia setting which removes legs from the spiders, making them look much more friendly!
                  
                     This mod has been commissioned by Aquiles and created and balanced by Vanilla Expanded team.
                        
                           Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Endangered biome expansion. It adds 11 new animals that will spawn as part of a new event. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.

            Mod Version: 1.8\n\n\nShows bubbles when pawns perform a social interaction with the text that would normally only be found in the log.\n\nBubbles will fade away after a short time but they are linked to the game time so pausing the game will halt the bubble from fading. Hovering over a bubble will make it nearly transparent and they can be clicked through to objects underneath. Use the toggle button in the play settings area to disable bubbles from being shown.

                                                      This mod changes surgery success to be less arbitrary and random. It doesn't change your surgeon's chance of success, but it does change failures in the following ways:
                                                         	
                                                            -If they don't succeed, they get a second chance to succeed with non-lethal injuries.
                                                               -If they fail, they have a chance to only give non-lethal injuries based on their surgery skill (as they identify that the patient is dying and abort the surgery).
                                                                  -If they fail that, then the death on failed surgery chance is reduced by their chance to successfully complete the surgery.
                                                                     -If the surgery is not lethal, the difference between catastrophic and minor failure is based on the surgery success chance, instead of being a literal coin flip.
                                                                        -Only impaired pawns will ever have ridiculous surgery injuries.
                                                                           -Instead of doing 20 damage on a minor failure and 65 on a catastrophic failure, minor failures do 10-20 damage and catastrophic failures do 30-60. This makes it so that some surgeries (like on the head) are not disproportionately lethal even on minor failures.
                                                                              -Instead of doing between 50-100% of a part's remaining health in damage per surgery injury, failures do between 10-25% of a part's remaining health, so that an injury is far less likely to kill or sever a part on a patient unless its total damage exceeds the part's remaining health.
                                                                                 -You will receive the body part or implant back on a minor failure.

            Load Items and People into transporters that are already in progress.
            		
               This mod allows you to avoid canceling a load group for transport pods by editing in-progress transport groups.
                  Forgot to load an item? Is some pawn interacting with an item that was selected, but is now unavailable? Then use this feature.

            1.4.0.2 (09-10-2021)
            
               Adds new types and sizes of doors to RimWorld and an extensible framework for other mods to add such doors.
                  
                     Currently included:
                        * Doors (2x1, 3x1) - Double/triple sized vanilla doors.
                           * Curtains (Tribal) (1x1, 2x1, 3x1) - Fragile, flammable, and made of fabric, these curtains provide fast movement through buildings.
                              * Jail Door (1x1) - Stronger door to keep prisoners inside.
                                 * Gates (2x1) - Stylized doors perfect for meeting pre-industrial needs.
                                    * Remote Doors (1x1, 2x1, 3x1) - Garage-style doors that can be opened by remote buttons or levers.
                                       * Blast Doors (2x1, 3x2) - Incredibly large and secure doors used to keep greater threats at bay. Also can be opened by remote buttons or levers.
                                          * Autodoors (2x1, 3x2) - Double/triple sized autodoors. All autodoors (including vanilla 1x1 autodoor) also can be opened by remote buttons or levers.

            Version: 2.7.1
            	
               &lt;size=20&gt;Description&lt;/size&gt;
                  Allows to randomize your starting maps and geyser locations until you find something you like.
                     Every reroll has a cost- in the form of unmined resources from your map.
                        
                           &lt;size=20&gt;How to use&lt;/size&gt;
                              Start a new game, or settle a new map. In the top right corner of the screen you will find a button with red dice. Click that.
                                 Use "Reroll Map" to pick a new map from a list of previews, or "Reroll Geysers" to get random new geyser positions on the current map.
                                    Each page of previews and geyser reroll operation will cost you an amount of unmined resources from the map- both the cost and the amount of remaining resources are displayed in the window.
                                       
                                          The resource cost is optional, and can be disabled in the Options &gt; Mod Settings menu.

            Replanting every dug up tree one by one is pain inducing. Screw that. Just replant them all at once. Once installed, look for a "Mass Replant" button in the orders menu

            Mine valuable ores before tunneling through rock. Prioritizes mining to the rarest metal first.
            
               Only your best miners will dig for valuables (if lower skilled miners yield less)

            Vanilla power generation is somewhat lackluster late game - Not only the game strongly encourages the use of solar panels and wind turbines as they provide significantly more energy at the cost of no fuel, but it also stops there - there is no technological progression in regards to power. Whether you’re an early industrial colony, or a spacer super-empire (and we all like to roleplay different ways), you’re bound to use the same power sources.
            
               Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Power module adds a plethora of new power sources, ranging all the way from small portable generators and large scale industrial ones, all the way to advanced spacer-tech green energy sources and a unique, and yet easy to understand nuclear generator. A selection of new batteries will help you with storing the power, whist the new utilities like a lightning rod and chemfuel pump will give you brand new ways of obtaining power and fuel.
                  
                     A new, vanilla-fitting energy chain has been added in the form of helixien gas - a combustible substance found mostly on the planets on the galaxy rim. It can be used to power a vast array of new gas-operated structures, making them completely immune from solar flares! Helixien gas can be stored in gas tanks for later use, uses a gas pipe system for connecting to structures and can easily be turned into electricity using gas-operated generators!

            NOTE: I (Windows XP) am not the original author of this mod. The original author is Rainbeau Flambe. He then stopped updating his mod so Saucy Pengiun did so. Then, 1.3 came out, Saucy Pengiun has not been active lately and the community really really wanted to play the Realistic Planets mod so I took it upon myself to make it happen.
            
               =====
                  
                     Have you ever noticed that RimWorld's planets all seem sort of the same? Or maybe you think they have too much land and not enough ocean? Or perhaps you've been bothered by the odd placement of certain biomes?
                        
                           Well, your worries are over!
                              
                                 "Realistic Planets" allows you to create a wider variety of planets, and also "cleans up" the game's biome placement so that the planets you play on look more... realistic.
                                    
                                       - Rainbeau Flambe (dburgdorf)
                                          
                                             =====
                                                
                                                   What It Does:
                                                      
                                                         (1) Planet Creation.
                                                            
                                                               The "Create World" page has been altered.
                                                                  
                                                                     First, you can now select "coverage" anywhere from 5% to 100%, in 5% increments, instead of having to choose between just 30%, 50% and 100%.
                                                                        
                                                                           Second, there's a new "sea level" slider, which determines the amount of ocean coverage your world will have. You can create anything from watery worlds with only a few small continents to barren rocks with no surface water at all.
                                                                              
                                                                                 The "rainfall" slider is now a relative rather than an absolute setting, as a planet's overall rainfall is influenced by its sea level. A "high" rainfall level on an arid planet, after all, will for obvious reasons be rather less than even a "low" rainfall level on a planet with extensive oceans.
                                                                                    
                                                                                       Additionally, the "temperature" settings have been "stretched," so that cold planets are colder than in vanilla, and hot planets are hotter, by up to about 15 degrees C at the ends of the scale.
                                                                                          
                                                                                             There's also now an "axial tilt" setting. Planets with higher axial tilts will have more extreme seasonal temperature shifts. (However, at least for now, changes to axial tilt do not alter the game's base day/night cycle.)
                                                                                                
                                                                                                   The mod also adds a set of "world type" options from which you can select. These are simply shortcuts to sets of slider settings intended to allow you to quickly and easily create planets predominantly characterized by particular biomes.

(It will not, however, alter your selected coverage setting, as that can impact game performance.)

Arid shrublands are described as semi-arid regions that surround deserts, yet in vanilla, they're placed in areas that are warm enough, but not rainy enough, to be rainforests. And deserts... well, in the vanilla game, any tile that's not rainy enough to be forest and not cold enough to be tundra, becomes desert.
                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                           The mod limits deserts to areas where the combination of temperature and rainfall makes deserts likely to actually exist, and moves arid shrublands to regions of the globe surrounding those newly-limited deserts.
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                 To fill in the gaps created by those changes, as well as to add a bit more variety, "Realistic Planets" adds several new biomes:
                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                       - Grasslands, as the name suggests, are areas where the vegetation is dominated by grasses and shrubs. The soil is fertile, but there is little protection from the elements.

A steppe may be semi-desert or covered with grass or shrubs or both, depending on the season and latitude.
                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                   - Savannas are mixed woodland/grassland ecosystems typically found between rainforests and deserts. Though savannas are more forested than grasslands, their trees are still spaced widely enough that sufficient light reaches the ground to support an unbroken layer of grasses. Despite the abundance of plants, the soil is mostly dry, and a wide variety of animals roam the area searching for food and water.

Vegetation is sparse, and the ground is typically more rocky than sandy.

In even the harshest of deserts, after all, groundwater occasionally manages to make it to the surface, and where it does, life blooms. Plants grow around small ponds, and animals gather in search of water and shade.
                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                     - Permafrost exists on the border between tundra and ice sheets. The ground is permanently frozen, and much of it is covered in ice, but the ice is at most a few meters, rather than kilometers, thick. There is little vegetation beyond scrub brush, and few animals. (Yes, this is the same as the biome from my "Permafrost" mod. "Realistic Planets" doesn't include that mod's water freezing mechanic, but the mods can be used together, if you want your lakes and rivers to freeze in cold weather.)

(These options will be automatically disabled if you're also using "Faction Control," in order to avoid conflicts.)

(Adding the mod to a game in progress will not, of course, alter any existing planet maps.)
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                               I've tried to make sure that this mod works with other mods that also alter planet generation. I have specifically confirmed that "Realistic Planets" is compatible with "More Random Seeds," "My Little Planet" and "Prepare Landing," though you'll want to turn off the latter's "precise world generation percentage" option to avoid meaningless but annoying error messages.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     "Realistic Planets" should also be compatible with other mods that add new biomes. If you happen to notice that a biome added by another mod seems a bit "out of place" as a side effect of the changes this mod makes to vanilla biome placements, let me know, and I'll be happy to see about adding a patch to deal with the problem. On a related note, if you're using "Terra Core" or "Advanced Biomes," both of which add a savanna biome, or "Nature's Pretty Sweet," which adds both a grassland and a savanna biome, you'll find that the biomes from those mods replace the similar ones from this mod. This is deliberate, as those mods' versions of the biomes add features that this mod doesn't make available.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Finally, plants and animals added by other mods will have a chance to show up in this mod's new biomes. However, since all I've done is specify that if modded animals or plants are defined to show up in vanilla biome "X," they should also have a chance to show up in new biome "Y," there may be oddities. So again, if you notice things that seem a bit out of place -- specific modded animals or plants showing up in biomes where they don't logically belong, or not showing up in biomes where they ought to be found -- let me know, and I'll see about fixing the issue.

            Did you know pawns can only have a total of 150 damage across all body parts before the pawn dies for no reason? This mod fixes that by telling ShouldBeDeadFromLethalDamageThreshold to go **** itself!
            
               Should be compatible with all mods and is save compatible!

            This mod disables the creation of random relations during the game.  No more blood relatives, ex-wives, lovers, etc showing up that should have been left behind.  Relationships formed by your colonists during the course of the game, "social" relations, and children (if using a mod which enables such a thing) should have relations generated normally.

            Moves the jump pack, low-shield, and some modded packs to the torso slot so they can be worn with belts.
            	
               Also moves the exoskeleton frame from VWE Heavy to its own layer, and some Rimmu-Nation items away from the torso, so they can still be worn with other utilities.

            Pawns now prefer to shoot at closest target. Pawns now change target automatically to closest foe more often.
                
                   Ваши пешки стреляют по дальним целям, и категорически не хотят переключаться автоматически на ближних?? Хватит это терпеть! 
                  С этим модом пешки будут стрелять по ближайшим целям гораздо охотнее.

            Occasionally, colonists will change their minds about things. They can gain a trait, lose a trait, or have the trait's degree change. This occurs about twice as often as cargo pods drop (or so, everything's random).
            
               Overview:
                  Traits can be gained as long as a colonist doesn't have 4 traits already
                     Traits can be lost
                        Traits with multiple degrees can change
                           
                              A few traits won't change, be removed, or be added, for various reasons:
                                 Beauty traits, annoying voice, and creepy breathing because they're physical traits not psychological, and beauty is already affected by Disfigured. 
                                    Gay because I don't want to get into a debate about whether sexuality can change like what happened early in RimWorld development.
                                       Brawler because I personally think Brawler is just stupid and your best shooter becoming a brawler is super annoying.
                                          Jealous, careful/trigger-happy shooter, and very/neurotic because the game doesn't let me change these ones for some reason. I'll look into them.
                                             
                                                Events may cause a colonist to change their ways (e.g. a colonist eats human flesh and discovers they like it, becomes cannibal; or a colonist is depressed for a while and loses trait optimist)
                                                   
                                                      Psychological disorders (treated by someone with good social; if they progress too far lead to mental breaks or suicide)
                                                         
                                                            Comment any bugs or suggestions! (especially bugs)

            This mod adds a gizmo to various buildings, allowing the player to adjust the building's placed offset. For example, you can nudge a building down a bit and tuck it behind a wall, giving it a better sense of perspective.

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Architect has been on my mind for a very long time. I always download every single mod adding new floors or fences, but I quickly become buried under all the new options, and eventually get pissed off because some of those options don't exactly fit Vanilla game in my eyes.
            	
               	I want new carpet colors, but I don't want all RGB hues - I want a small, tailored selection that fits the game. I want new tiles and floors, but I don't want 100 different patterns that have no distinction between them other than the looks. I want new fences, but I don't want more fence types than there are floor types. I want less, but I want more significant!
                  	
                     	Thus, Architect Expanded was born. Not only does it add new walls, fences, floors and carpets in various, vanilla-fitting colors, it also adds stone and metal bridges, as well as foundations that you can place on sand, so building in the desert will no longer be a problem! I seem to have forgotten to mention that wood now comes in 4 colors, all using just the base wood resource - so you can decide upon building what color your wooden objects will be!
                        	
                           	I really hope you will enjoy everything this mod has to offer, and it will allow you to make your colony at least twice as beautiful to look at.

            I have always found vanilla furniture to be lacking in depth and quantity. After researching Complex Furniture, the research tree for furniture pretty much ends, with a couple of odd technologies adding things like Vitals Monitors and Hospital Beds along the way. As part of the Vanilla Furniture Expanded mod, the team consisting of the Author of Android Tiers, Atlas, and me would like to add some sort of progression to the furniture of the rim, whilst also keeping it Vanilla friendly.

            Vanilla Textures Expanded - Variations is a standalone release in the Vanilla Textures Expanded series, aiming at providing a LOT of visual variety to your vanilla bases.
            
               So, what does it do? Basically, it provides building graphics variations for the majority of vanilla‚Äôs buildings. This means every time you build a chair, the chair will have a randomized graphics. Not only that, but you can also swap the graphic of the building on command, allowing you to mix and match styles to properly decorate your base.
                  
                     The mod includes more than 150 new random building graphics for 35 vanilla buildings.

            Not all injuries are equal; pharmacist prescribes the right medicine for the job.
            
               &lt;size=24&gt;Important&lt;/size&gt;
                  Does not require a new save game 
                     Can safely be enabled in an ongoing save-game, disabling will cause a one-time error message upon loading the save again for the first time. The error message is mostly harmless.
                        
                           &lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
                              Pharmacist allows you to set the maximum level of medicine that may be used for certain treatments. Doctors will use the best medicine that is available, and that is at most the level of the targets’ medical care setting and the pharmacists’ advice. Four levels of injuries are distinguished;
                                 
                                    
                                       Minor (bruises, non-lethal diseases, small cuts)
                                          Major (larger cuts, potentially lethal diseases)
                                             Life-Threathening (extreme bleeding, heart attacks, etc.)
                                                Operations (all implants, harvesting, etc.)
                                                   
                                                      The Pharmacists’ advice for each of these can be set for Colonists, Guests, Prisoners and Animals separately with the ‘Pharmacist’ button on the main bar.
                                                         
                                                            &lt;size=24&gt;Notes&lt;/size&gt;
                                                               Doctors out on the rim treat wounds in batches, and use the same medicine for each treatment in a batch. I did not want to confuse them too much, so I’ve left that behaviour intact. That means that the worst injury determines what medicine is used for the whole batch, and doctors may still use Glitterworld medicine for treating a bruise if they were treating a heart attack at the same time.
                                                                  
                                                                     As far as I know, the mod should be compatible with everything. Mods that directly alter the available number of medical care options may cause issues, and I think I’ve seen such a mod at one point, but I’ve been unable to find it again. If you find any incompatibilities, please let me know!
                                                                        
                                                                           I’m not quite happy with the UI yet, but for now it’s functional. If you have suggestions, I’m always willing to listen. 
                                                                              
                                                                                 Some injuries might be diagnosed wrong, and receive medicine that is either not good enough or too good. If the treatment is too good, make sure that it wasn’t part of a batch treatment (see above). If the treatment is not good enough, that’s a bigger problem, and I’d like to know about what injuries are diagnosed badly.

                  If the finished object does not met your minimum quality requirements, it will get deconstructed and replaced in same position and same stuff

                           		You can choose an interval from once a quadrum to hourly. Rendered images will be saved in a chosen directory. For example you can use them to create an animated gif or video of your current run.
                              
                                 		Place special corner marker designators to limit the area of what should be rendered. You can limit this to your base and even just simply extend it later if you base grows larger than planned.

                                Also try balance and stay in line with vanilla and other mods on workshop, without going too OP.
                                   Or too far.

            Tired of reading through the raid letter to discern the important details, such as what kind of raid it is, how many raiders there are, whether they are attacking immediately, etc? Now you can see those details at a glance without even opening the letter!
            
               Each raid letter comes with several icons on top of the letter, depending on what type of raid it is. The first icon is the faction symbol, followed by the number of raiders. The icons that come after that (if any) indicate the following:
                  - clock: preparing for a while (not attacking immediately)
                     - arrows: approaching from multiple angles
                        - brain: raiders are clever and will avoid traps/turrets
                           - drop pod: raiders are dropping right on top of you!
                              - four drop pods: pods went haywire and are landing all over the place
                                 - axe: breach/sapper raid
                                    - missile: siege

            Constantly checking the shooting range of your colonists/turrets? Range Finder makes it easy.
            
               Just select one or more colonists/turrets and press the hotkey (Ctrl by default). When you quickly press the key twice the range will be shown until you press the key later again.

            Vanilla UI Expanded is a brand new addition to the Vanilla Expanded collection, this time around bringing some important quality of life features regarding the interface of RimWorld. We’re very well aware that there are many UI mods out there, by the likes of RimHUD, Numbers etc. Our goal was never to replace them - instead, we focused on additions that no one has added before.
            
               		Vanilla UI Expanded allows for an incredible depth of customization for the UI, including creating new Architect tabs on the go, grouping gizmos and buttons together etc. You can finally clean up your architect tab so that you no longer have the whole screen covered by all the amazing furniture added by your 600 mods.

            Mod Version: 1.10.1\n\nRimHUD is a UI mod that displays detailed information about a selected character or creature. The HUD display is integrated into the inspect pane which can be resized to fit the additional information. Alternatively, the HUD can display a separate floating window and can be docked to any position on the screen.\n\nVisual warnings will appear if a pawn has any life-threatening conditions, has wounds that need tending to, or is close to a mental breakdown.

            Replaces the faction tab with a relations tab. The relations tab shows, in a very graphical way, relations between your colonists and with other factions. 
            
               &amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Notes&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
                  In games with many faction mods or a lot of colonists, the dynamic displays may ‘explode’. There’s three things you can do to mitigate this problem;
                     
                        
                           Use the static circle view. In the top right of the tab there is a button to switch between circle and dynamic views (may be hidden underneath the tutorial window).
                              Reset the dynamic view until it stops exploding. The button to reset the dynamic algorithm is in the top right of the window, next to that for cicle view (and may also be hidden by the tutorial).
                                 Tweak the parameters for the dynamic algorithm. In the mod options (Menu -&amp;amp;amp;gt; Options -&amp;amp;amp;gt; Mod Options -&amp;amp;amp;gt; Relations Tab) you can tweak the parameters for the algorithm. There is a short description of what each parameter does in the options as well.
                                    
                                       &amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Known issues&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
                                          
                                             In games with a lot of factions/colonists, the algorithm may ‘explode’. See the ‘Notes’ section on how to fix this.
                                                Some mods (noticably, the Zabrak faction) change pawn rendering in such a way that it breaks the relations tab. I’m looking for the root cause of this.

            Replace the stuff that a thing is made from, e.g. replace a wall's materials.
            	
               This mod does NOT deconstruct and reconstruct. It preserves the existing building and replaces materials in-place.
                  
                     Also, blueprints are allowed over rock and fog.
                        	
                           A new button in the Architect/Structure menu to replace any building's materials.
                              Regular buildings that are ordered to be built on top of a copy are replaced instead of reconstructed.
                                 		
                                    It doesn't break down the existing building, which means:
                                       Replacing walls doesn't break the room, and keeps freezers cold.
                                          Replacing workbenches doesn't delete bills.
                                             
                                                Check Steam page for any updated info.

            Research bench is no longer just a cumbersome object - now it shows useful info about currently performing research.
            	
               You don't need to open research window or to recall to find what kind of research is being performed - all you have to do is just click on that bulky thing called "research bench" and you will see the title, progress and even estimated time* to complete current project.
                  *Estimated time only shown when research is actually being performed.
                     
                        For more detailed information, open the "Project" tab attached to the bench.

            Prefer to get food from the dining room.
            
               Colonists will get food from the nearest room with a table, before checking elsewhere.
                  This includes lower quality food. The assumption is that you put the food in that room to be eaten. So colonists do will do that.
                     
                        Food in hospital rooms will also be used for patients in that hospital, and the same for food in prisons for prisoners.
                           
                              You'll probably want RimFridge for this to make sense.

            Your colonists can never be a true Rambo if they cannot gun while they are running. Therefore, this mod adds a mode that, when enabled, allows drafted colonists to shoot 
            while moving at the cost of an accuracy and movement penalty.These penalties can be modified in the mod settings of this mod. 
               Some things to take into account: 
                  - Fire at will should be enabled. Firing manually will cause the pawn to stop running. 
                     - RunAndGun mode can only be enabled when the pawn is drafted, and is carrying a ranged weapon in its hands. 
                        - The movement penalty is only applied at the moment the pawn is actually shooting or cooling down after shooting. So don't bother disabling RunAndGun every time you just want your pawn to walk somewhere. 
                           
                              &lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dependencies &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;
                                 
                                    This mod depends on Hugslib, so make sure that mod loads before this mod does.
                                       
                                          &lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compatibility &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;
                                             
                                                This mod should be compatible with existing saves, and removing the mod from saves shouldn't introduce problems. Moreover, this mod should be compatible with most other mods (including Combat Extended). However, keep in mind that this is hard to test for me by myself, and this is the first release.
                                                   Therefore some issues regarding mod compatibility are bound to come up. Most issues that come up should be easy to fix, so please report any problems.

            Vanilla Armour Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Weapons Expanded and Vanilla Apparel Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.
            
               Armor is spread across several new technologies that need to be researched which in turn adds valuable game time before you achieve everything there is to achieve. New items cover all technological eras, from wooden armours of neolithic tribes, through chainmails and chestplates of medieval kingdoms, bulletproof vests and ghillie suits of the modern era combat all the way to two, brand new variants of a regular marine armor - one of them with an integrated ranged shield belt!

               Used the exact same AI as enemy pawns, so please don't get mad at me when your pawns screw up. This mod is intended to complement manual control and alleviate some micro-management, not to completely replace manual control.

            Semi Random Research gives the player three random research options to choose from. Settings allow the player to reroll the options if desired, to increase or decrease the number of research projects, and to automatically select the next research project after each completion. There is a setting to disable the feature so that it can be bypassed temporarily without having to remove and readd the mod to a save.
            	
               The options appear in the "Next Research" tab, near the original "Research" tab. This allows for compatibility with mods like ResearchPal that override the original research  tab.

            Doctors will use medicine from their inventory. What a concept!
            		
               Doctors can also use medicine from the patient's inventory, or anyone else on the map, even pack animals brought on a caravan.
                  
                     They can also keep their inventory stocked with medicine. The Gear Tab has Settings for each Colonist.
                        
                           An option to use cheaper medicine, if it will do just as well ( due to doctor skill, bionics, medical bed, etc. ) Note this doesn't affect surgery.
                              
                                 An option to use minimal medicine for non-urgent wounds, or none at all.
                                    
                                       An option to tend patients in the field - if there are no beds available, or just always.
                                          
                                             Multiple doctors can reserve the same stack of medicine. The game actually supports multiple reservations, but the feature was just not used.
                                                
                                                   Now technically, inventory medicine is dropped and immediately picked back up - but what can you do.
                                                      
                                                         Check Steam page for any updated info.

            [h1]Changelog[/h1]
            5 July 2021: Mod marked as compatible with 1.3. Mod appears to function with zero changes necessary, but please report any errors you encounter ASAP!
               28 Jan 2021: Simplified and Traditional Chinese translations added, courtesy of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198412879575]Zephyr[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/leafzxg]leafzxg[/url]!
                  15 Jan 2021: Mod launched!
                     
                        [h1]What this mod does[/h1]
                           Sick and tired of having your carefully designed defenses for your pawns completely thrown into chaos by a single raider with a molotov cocktail? Groaning in frustration when one hit from an inferno cannon, a hit that does exactly zero damage to your legendary-armored pawns, causes them to run [b]TOWARDS[/b] the line of approaching Centipedes just because there's a one-tile puddle of water out in the open?
                              
                                 Teach your pawns to Stop, Drop, and Roll! This mod replaces the default "panic from fire" behavior of your colonists with a more intelligent one: the pawn stops whatever they're currently doing [b]NOT[/b] to run around uselessly or towards water, but to focus on extinguishing themselves on the spot. If you feel like fire is too effective of a weapon against your foes, you can optionally enable this behavior on non-colonist pawns and even animals; or, if you want to rely solely on the second system introduced by this mod, that of "IgnitionChance", you can disable this behavior on your own pawns as well.
                                    
                                       Additionally, apparel and its Heat Armor now assist with fire prevention. Heat Armor above a certain threshold on apparel is used to calculate a new value called "IgnitionChance", which serves to reduce the chance a pawn would be set on fire. By default, all pawns (including enemies) and animals benefit from this new system, but if you're feeling sadistic, you can disable this for enemies and/or animals. You can also disable it for your own colonists, if you'd rather rely solely on the "stop, drop, and roll" mechanic… and if you're feeling masochistic, you can disable the IgnitionChance system for just your own colonists while keeping it active for non-colonists and animals. Everything is modifiable and customizable in the mod options window!
                                          
                                             [h1]Hard numbers[/h1]
                                                Rimworld's code uses a single method to set pawns on fire. Whenever this method is used, this mod patches it to first be checked by a series of calculations similar to (but not identical to) how attacks are resolved against armor.
                                                   
                                                      The mod starts with two predefined but user-modifiable values: "Ignition resistance strength" (IRS) and "Minimum heat armor rating to resist ignition" (MHA). By default, these are "4" and "0.25", respectively.
                                                         
                                                            The first step when the game code attempts to set a pawn on fire is that a outside-depth body part (aka, not an internal organ such as the heart or brain, but possibly an outside-depth sub-part such as eyes, nose, or jaw) is randomly selected, using the exact same process as how regular attacks select a body part. (Because the base game is dumb and doesn't protect hands and feet by default, hands and feet have been excluded from this roll.)
                                                               
                                                                  Next, all layers of apparel covering that body part are checked from outermost to innermost. Each layer of apparel has a calculated "IgnitionChance" that equals 100% - IRS(Heat Armor of Apparel - MHA).
                                                                     
                                                                        A random roll between 0 and 100 is now made and compared to IgnitionChance. If the roll is greater than ignition chance, that layer of apparel has resisted ignition and the pawn is not set on fire. If the roll is less than or equal to IgnitionChance, then that layer of apparel has failed to prevent the pawn from catching on fire, and the process moves to the next layer of apparel. If there are no layers of apparel remaining (or none to begin with), the pawn catches fire as normal.
                                                                           
                                                                              With the default values of 4 and 0.25 for IRS and MHA, this means that any value of Heat Armor on apparel less than 25% does not contribute to reducing IgnitionChance, while every percent of Heat Armor above 25% reduces IgnitionChance's base chance of 100% by 4%. A piece of apparel with 26% Heat Armor has a 96% IgnitionChance, while one with 49% Heat Armor has a 4% IgnitionChance. For reference, all base game apparel made of Devilstrand easily reaches &gt;50% Heat Armor at normal quality, making it a completely "fireproof" layer. Marine armor is in a similar position, having 54% Heat Armor at normal quality. Note that while hands and feet have been excluded, the head and the face are their own body parts! An open-faced helmet risks your pawn being set on fire still on an unlucky roll to determine body part, and you will need a Marine helmet or equivalent in conjunction with clothing to fully fireproof your pawns.
                                                                                 
                                                                                    Depending on the way apparel attributes are balanced in your mod-list, the default values of 4 and 0.25 for IRS and MHA may not be appropriate. If your mod-list's point of balance is very different from that of the base game, and you're rolling with extremely powerful armor, or perhaps focusing on a low-tech playthrough, raising or lowering these values may be required.
                                                                                       
                                                                                          Note that IgnitionChance is an entirely separate process from direct weapon damage, which uses Heat Armor as normal. Even if a pawn's body parts are all covered in apparel with 0% IgnitionChance, direct hits from incendiary weapons will still attempt to deal direct damage as normal, opposed by Heat Armor.
                                                                                             
                                                                                                I don't even want to think about CE compatibility. You guys are on your own.
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                      [h1]How will this mod affect my gameplay?[/h1]
                                                                                                         With the default settings, fire becomes way less of an instant "I lose" problem for your own colony, while also becoming somewhat less of an instant "I win" button to use against certain enemies. Although non-colonists (aka enemy pawns) do not use the "stop, drop, and roll" behavior, they do still benefit from the IgnitionChance system. Most tribal attire will still be well below the (default) MHA needed to decrease IgnitionChance, so you can still have your war crimes against the indigenous peoples of your rimworld, but pirates and outlanders in power armor may be sufficiently geared to shrug off incendiary assault.

               A set of tools to make your life on the Rim a bit easier.
                  Easily forbid and unforbid items, select similar things, have things hauled urgently and affect the entire map with powerful new tool extensions.
                     
                        All tools are found in the Architect &gt; Orders menu. Right-click tools with the small mouse icon to access their special context actions.
                           
                              Pressing the Context Action key ("Equals" by default) will activate the first right-click menu action of the tool you are holding. 
                                 
                                    All tools are accessible from anywhere by pressing their shortcut key without opening the menu. See the Keyboard configuration panel in the options menu to customize the hotkeys.

            Pawns will stop social fighting if they're badly hurt or in a lot of pain.
              
               Masochists ignore pain when social fighting.
                    
                     Bloodlusties will not stop social fighting until either their opponent gives in, dies, or is downed.
                        
                           Pawns who are romantically involved have a chance to stop social fighting if one has a positive opinion of the other.

            A small mod which simply lets you build power conduits underground. It uses the same amount of resources, as it is essentially the exact same thing, but the trench building process is over 10x more labor intensive compared to laying down surface cables.
            		
               		This mod derives from old2's beta19 version of this mod.

            Vanilla Chemfuel Expanded is a small mod created to showcase what the new Pipe network code is capable of in Vanilla Expanded framework. It adds a simple chain to extract Deepchem from the underground pockets and refine it into Chemfuel. It also adds storage solutions for both Deepchem and standard chemfuel, alongside a few structures including a Refinery and Chemfuel tap. Player can now connect any refuelable chemfuel-powered structures to the pipe network to make sure everything refuels automatically.
            	
               This mod is not trying to be better than other available chemfuel-related mods. Instead, it exists to showcase what our framework is capable of doing, and to provide an example for other modders what they can do if they choose to use Vanilla Expanded Framework. As a by-product, it's a vanilla-friendly mod that adds an infinite source of chemfuel provided that the player constructs the required infrastructure.

            A giraffe is probably the most recognizable african animal. For some reason, it’s not in the vanilla base game, and your african tribe immersion is forever ruined. Crocodiles can never hunt you around the river bank, hippopotami can’t rip your arms off with a single bite and you can’t hear coyotes around the campfires. Except, now you can.

            Boreal forest is a biome drastically needing some new, unique animals. With this module, you can see famous american black bears - smaller cousins of the grizzly bears, as well as arctic coyotes and tiny otters.
            
               Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Boreal Forest biome expansion. It adds 3 new animals that will spawn in the Boreal Forest, but some of them also spawn in other biomes. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.

            No animal mod, or in this instance, mod series, can be complete without Lions. This mod, albeit being smaller to not overpopulate the desolate deserts of the planet, contains some of the most popular and requested - and dangerous - animals that can most often be found in the desert. With this particular mod you can hear hyena’s laughter echo through the night, train your own pack of lions, tackle a desert tortoise and die due to venom injected by the feared gila monster.

            What this mod series was certainly lacking is some Ice Sheet animals. Adding them was quite difficult as the biome itself hardly supports any plant life - and whilst I can feel free to add animals, they need to be able to sustain themselves. Additionally, I needed to make sure that the Sea Ice biome gets enough treatment to be unique, whilst still being extremely difficult to play in. With this mod you are able to fend off the flocks of penguins and hunt walruses for their precious tusks! Not only that, as penguins will periodically dig for fish, so if you’re particularly unlucky, you can scavenge their leftovers!

            After all the other animal mods have been finished, it is time to introduce the one final animal mod to Vanilla Expanded mod series. Vanilla Animals Expanded - Temperate Forest mod adds a small number of animals to a very popular for beginners temperate forest biome. Whilst the biome is already very diverse animal wise, I feel like it was missing something that makes it unique. All of the vanilla animals that spawn in Temperate biome can also spawn almost everywhere else, so we, Vanilla Expanded Co. decided to add something truly unique - red pandas, wild geese, badgers, beavers that build wooden dams on the rivers, and of course - hedgehogs!

            After having my first Spaceship launch in the tropical rainforest biome, I have noticed it actually didn’t feel as tropical as I would like it to feel. Monkeys, tortoises, an elephant here and there, it doesn’t really give away that unique, diverse environment vibe. Sarg and I have decided to expand on it with a range of new, unique animals, which include gorillas and mandrills - possibly the most “jungle” animals there are. It is absolutely possible to tame your own army of tigers and send them off to hunt down the enemies, just as it is possible to have a peaceful tapir farm on the outskirts of the jungle!

            Tropical swamp never really had this “oh, this zone is dangerous” feel. It felt just like any other swamp. This very module, albeit only adding 3 new animals, is our way to remedy this. Alligators and Anacondas will now actively hunt in the tropical swamp biome, and they are a force to be reckoned with. To ease things up, we have also added Indian elephants - smaller versions of their african counterparts, with no tusks that can be sold. They are significantly easier to hunt and tame, and are a useful pack animal.

            Tundra biome always felt devoid of any actual unique animals. With this module, we have introduced Musk oxen and a moose - a beautiful symbol of Canada, which can be milked every couple of days just like an already existing in the game Elk. Porcupines are tiny rodents, similar in a lot of ways to Capybaras, with sharp quills used to repel predators. Beware of the Megawolverines though! They are genetically modified experiment out of control, by many described as just large balls of fur and claws. Taming one could be a challenge, but having one ready for combat is a huge advantage.

            Vanilla Genetics Expanded is an overhaul to a popular mod by Sarg Bjornson called Genetic Rim. The mechanics of the predecessor have been improved greatly to fit Vanilla Expanded playstyle, offering many new paths to explore in a mid to late game colony. You can now incubate unique hybrids using brand new genetic engineering system, utilising powerful boosters and genoframes to create animals stronger, smarter and quicker than anything you've ever seen. Stay vigilant though, as there is always a chance of an experiment failing, producing one of many new failure outcomes - such as cute and cuddly fleshlings, or powerful, ever-expanding fleshgrowth.
            	
               	Venture out into the unknown with a new abandoned lab quest, procure equipment needed to continue experiments, breed paragon creatures - a real pinacle of bio-engineering, and in the end give life to an Archocentipede through a brand new path to end the game.
                  	
                     	Vanilla Genetics Expanded introduces a Hybrid quality system, encouraging the player to create higher-quality hybrids which get improved stats across the board. Alternatively, focus on overwhelming the enemy with hordes of lower quality beasts. At the end of the day, it's all up to you.
                        	
                           	With Ideology DLC, two new memes will allow you to explore different avenues of the bio-engineering path. Will you be a wicked scientist? Or will you follow things by the book?

            We have all been there, with a colony of a hundred pawns where everyone looks somewhat the same. Starting colonists with no character to their looks. This mod is our attempt at fixing that.
            
               We have worked hard to create a hundred new hairstyles that fit vanilla RimWorld perfectly! From tribals to space refugees, every possible pawn receives a set of new, fitting styles that add much needed character and soul to them, and with so many new possibilities, it’s unlikely two of your pawns will look the same!
                  
                     And in case they do, one of our major features is a barber’s table - a workbench available to be built from the very start of the game, that allows you to change the hairstyle, colour and beard style of your pawns. Yes, you heard me right. We’re also adding 15 beards, which have a solid 20% chance to spawn on any male colonist! If, however, beards are not something you’re into, you can disable them in the mod settings!

               This mod introduces many new headgear types and one new outfit type for your ideological pawns. No longer you will be limited by the selected few new headwraps and burkas for your Role generation - your leaders will now be able to wear amazing new headgear such as Horse mask or fez, while moralists will adorn themselves in rags, similar to those of typical monks.
                  
                     On top of that, Vanilla Apparel Expanded apparel is also patched with this mod, allowing it to be desired by ideologies or specific roles! Of course it doesn’t mean it’s random or anything, on the contrary, you can now expect that your shooting specialists might require military apparel, while medical specialists will want to wear medical scrubs.

               Relics and Artifacts module introduces over 40 new inert relics to join the small selection of relics in vanilla game. No longer you will be bound to have a mysterious cube, or an ark, or  a shard. We’ve added scrolls, statuettes, idols, sword shards, gauntlets, mechanoid heads, tech parts and many, many more.
                  
                     Furthermore, this mod adds patches to apparel, allowing it to also be a relic, because I got tired of seeing all the possible guns as relics, but not helmets, armors etc.
                        
                           This of course increases the list of possible relics with hundreds of new items, so we have overhauled the relic selection UI, and added a search bar so it’s easier to find what you want!

            Vanilla Plants Expanded is a core module in a plant-based in the new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team. After hours of designing, testing and  designing again, Sarg Bjornson, Oskar Potocki and Chowder are proud to present this content pack to help you with your RimWorld farming simulator. This mod features a variety of fruit plants and crops to spice up your fields, with each prop adding something different and unique, allowing you to use the power of farming differently based on your situation and needs.
            
               Adding a variety of crops, each with different mechanics and traits, but still kept within vanilla balancing, we are hoping to give you a chance to tailor your farming industry to your liking. These plants are not meant to replace vanilla plants - they are balanced in-line with those, meaning rice and potatoes will still be useful!
                  
                     Fruit trees are biome-locked to two unique new fruit trees per biome, however bear in mind they do not differ nutrition-wise from one another - which is partly the reason why we decided to biome lock them. We also didn’t want to flood your farming menus with 12 different fruit trees that yield pretty much the same, but reskinned, item. This has all been done with the ease of use in mind.
                        
                           A new ability to plow soil has also been introduced once you meet the designated research. Plowing soil boosts its fertility to that of Rich soil, however when the plant is harvested, tilled soil returns to its previous form and needs to be plowed again.
                              
                                 This mod has built in patches for Vanilla Cooking Expanded, adding new functionality, such as new condiment recipes!

            Vanilla Plants Expanded - More Plants is an add-on module for Vanilla Plants Expanded from the Vanilla Expanded team. This mod adds a variety of fruit plants and crops to spice up your fields even further, with each prop adding something different and unique, allowing you to use the power of farming differently based on your situation and needs.
            
               Two new unique types of growing zone have been added: sandy and aquatic growing zones. These add new crops each, that can only be grown on them. They ignore fertility, but their crops will take a long time to sow and harvest, basically exchanging colonist work for growing plants in a normally unused space.
                  
                     Finally, by researching vegetable milk production, you can turn rice, coconuts, almonds, oats (with VE Cooking) and Soybeans (with VE Sushi) into milk. This is inefficient, and useful if a recipe NEEDS base game milk. It is not a way to work around Fine meals needing meat or animal products.

            Vanilla Trading Expanded is our take on the trading system and RimWorld, meant to add some much needed randomization, planning and strategy to otherwise stale trading. Currently in RimWorld, all values are flat and never change - meaning there are certain things that sell, and certain things that don’t. This mod will change that making market value of things dynamic, and changing based on the supply and demand.
            This mod overhauls the trading system and adds many new features, such as the Bank, Planetary news network, fluctuating prices, squeezes and crashes, loans, contracts, stock market etc. Please note this is not meant to be a realistic representation of the economy - I am not an economist, and I also don't want it to be realistic. It's simplified and almost arcadey, because it's a video game, and we don't need a corrupt market in the game to remind us how bad it is outside of it.

            Have you ever thought about how base game traits become repetitive after a while? Are you tired of seeing pyromaniac or kind pawn over and over again? Are you perhaps considering pyromaniac to be an instant death sentence in your colony? If for any of these questions the answer was ‘aye’, then look no further.
            
               Vanilla Traits Expanded adds 55 new traits, some offering unique new game mechanics, some being quirky and enhancing the storytelling, and some being straight up stat upgrades. Traits’ commonality has been adjusted after weeks of testing, to make sure no powerful or annoying traits appear too often.
                  
                     Using our new mod options menu, you can now disable specific traits added by vanilla game or any of the mods you have. This doesn’t mean that the trait will be magically removed from the pawn, but it’s commonality will be reduced to 0, stopping it from ever appearing in the game again.
                        
                           I really hope you will enjoy the effect of our hard work! Let us know in the comments what you think works and what doesn’t!

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Coilguns is an addition to one of the most popular mods of Vanilla Expanded collection - Vanilla Weapons Expanded, however it can be played without it. This mod adds a selection of spacer-tech weapons, fully craftable upon researching mass drivers technology. Coilguns come with a unique gimmick - whilst their firing speed and aiming time are quite unforgiving, projectiles fires from these weapons pierce any target they hit - flesh or metal, as well as any obstacles. Each obstacle reduces damage dealt to the next unlucky object/creature, but effectively these weapons allow your colonists to score multi-kills with a single shot.
            
               Shots fired by these weapons cannot penetrate mountains or reinforced walls from Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Spacer.
                  
                     Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.

            With a brand new utility item code introduced in RimWorld 1.2 update, I saw it as a perfect fit to make grenades be actually useful instead of forcing you to choose between a grenade and a rifle. By crafting grenade belts, you can now equip all vanilla and vanilla expanded grenade types on your pawn alongside any weapon you wish, and use them manually by selecting a special “throw grenade” button on the menu, next to the draft button.
            
               You heard it right, now you can launch grenades and continue to fire your assault carbine at your enemies! No need to call out that single useless colonist that always carries just grenades.
                  
                     What’s the drawback? Grenades on the belt are limited, much like the ammo for the Grenadier suit in Royalty DLC, you now need to refill the grenades after the charges deplete. You refill them using the grenade type they are made out of - Frag grenade belt gets refilled with frag grenades etc.

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Laser is an addition to one of the most popular mods of Vanilla Expanded collection - Vanilla Weapons Expanded, however it can be played without it. This mod adds a selection of ultratech weapons, with a small number of them craftable, whilst keeping the majority of them only obtainable from the enemy drops, world quests and traders. Laser weapons introduce a new projectile type - a laser beam that has a slight chance of setting the enemy on fire. These weapons have high armour piercing and are extremely effective in combat against armored enemies and mechanoids.
            
               Salvaged Laser weapons are obtainable by players using a new Salvage laser weapon recipe, which uses intellectual skill of pawns and allows them to look through advanced components to come up with a random laser weapon. Salvaged laser weapons are less accurate than their state-of-the-art ultratech counterparts, and are more prone to overheating.
                  
                     Laser weapons have a brand new warm-up mechanic making them perfect for defensive battles - the longer your pawn is stationary whilst firing, the faster the weapon can fire. Once it reaches maximum firing speed however, it can overheat, causing a small explosion with a chance of setting your pawn on fire.

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Non-Lethal has been a commonly requested weapon set. So many times prison breaks result in accidental deaths. So many times, an enemy raider is your colonist’s father and you accidentally put a sniper rifle round through his skull. So many times your berserk pawn starts to fight with your melee expert with archotech arms, resulting in, well, death.
            
               Thanks to this mod, you will now have numerous ways of dispatching crowds and taking down single targets - you can use tear gas to blind groups of opponents, tasers to stun single targets, and dart guns to bring down even the hardest foes in a matter of seconds.

                                                      Adds several new features to stockpile filters for added control over what to store, how much to store, and when to fill a stockpile. 
                                                         
                                                            Created for use with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2207657844]Variety Matters[/url], you can now create a stockpile near your cook that will hold small stacks of different ingredients, increasing the diversity of ingredients used in meals.

For example, with a duplicate limit of 2, pawns will never store more than 2 stacks of corn, no matter how large the stockpile.

Useful to divide limited supplies of medicine among multiple stockpiles.

Move the slider all the way to the right for vanilla behavior. Move it to the left and pawns will stop refilling any stacks until a certain number of cells are empty. Once pawns start refilling, they will keep filling the stockpile until full.

There is a toggle to start/stop refilling that appears when appropriate. If you toggle off a completely empty stockpile, it will disable the stockpile until manually restarted.

            Colonist will now be more likely to do jobs nearby instead of walking long distances.
              
                 Have you been tired of seeing your colonist walking 100 tiles just to harvest that single corn before walking another 100 tiles back to sow the empty healroot fields, and then walk to the corn again because another corn plant just matured? Fear not as this mod comes into rescue.
                    
                       Details:
                          - Nearby Job Search
                             Pawns will now boost priorities of work jobs nearby (12 tiles radius) by 1. This only activates if vanilla decides to give a work job that is too far away (32 tiles away). Non work jobs (eating, sleeping, etc.) are not affected.
                                
                                   - Vanilla Chance:
                                      There is a 5% chance that colonist skip this mod logic and always stick to vanilla behavior. This makes sure that colonist will not be bind to the same location for too long.
                                         (5% means we reduced the long walking cost by 20 times, which should be enough for efficiency purposes)
                                            
                                               - Configuration:
                                                  The numbers mentioned above can be changed in the mod settings.
                                                     
                                                        Safe to add or remove from saves.
                                                           
                                                              ALPHA version, expecting bugs.
                                                                 
                                                                    Planned Feature Next:
                                                                     	* Add more tiers for priority boost based on distance.
                                                                        	* Different settings for each colonist.

            "Greatest hauling mod ever" - Chicken Plucker
            
               	 v1.1.1⅓
                  
                     Colonists will gather stuff in their inventory, then haul it all to a stockpile.
                        
                           This hauling mod will greatly increase hauling efficiency, because pawns can now carry more than one gun or t-shirt. Those smart and intelligent colonists can use their inventory!
                              
                                 Safe to add to existing games.
                                    Fully compatible with Combat Extended. &lt;size=20&gt;Credits and thanks:&lt;/size&gt;

            &lt;b&gt;Opportunistic hauling; haul-to-inventory improvements (if &lt;i&gt;Pick Up And Haul&lt;/i&gt; is installed).&lt;/b&gt;
            A must-have with PUAH. Compatible with existing saves. Any load order.
               The following description is for RimWorld &lt;b&gt;1.3&lt;/b&gt;.
                  
                     Recognizing this mod: "on the way to", "closer to", "Efficiently unloading".
                        
                           80% of this mod is improving &lt;color=grey&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pick Up And Haul&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; (optional; installed separately). If you already use PUAH, you want this mod too.
                              
                                 "But my pawns are walking farther!"
                                    Yes. A slightly longer journey now to avoid a &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; longer journey next time.
                                       
                                          &lt;color=teal&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pick Up And Haul+&lt;/i&gt;: Better unloading&lt;/color&gt;
                                             We enhance all inventory hauling by unloading only once at each storage destination, in closest order.
                                                We improve performance by caching haulable destinations.
                                                   
                                                      &lt;color=teal&gt;Opportunistic hauls&lt;/color&gt;
                                                         Vanilla has support for opportunities, but with limitations: haulable near your &lt;b&gt;start&lt;/b&gt; position, and storage near your job.
                                                            We prefer these, but drop them as requirements to include hauls along the path.
                                                               
                                                                  We skip opportunities when bleeding or forming a caravan.
                                                                     
                                                                        &lt;i&gt;Pick Up And Haul+&lt;/i&gt;
                                                                           Modified to grab only surrounding things whose unload path is also opportunistic.
                                                                              
                                                                                 &lt;color=teal&gt;Haul extra supplies &amp; ingredients closer&lt;/color&gt;
                                                                                    If hauling resources to storage would bring them closer to their job, do that first (grabbing extra).
                                                                                       
                                                                                          &lt;i&gt;Pick Up And Haul+&lt;/i&gt;
                                                                                             Modified to grab extra things headed to the same storage (when higher priority).
                                                                                                Grab extra supplies &amp; ingredients headed to the same storage (when equal priority).

                                                                                                         Permit or deny for any storage building through settings, or leave automatically managed with mod updates.

            This is a fork and continuation of Open the Windows. The original mod was by jptrrs, patched to 1.3 by MangoThunder, with seamless texture edits by Yap. All three have been rolled together along with a number of optimizations, updates and balances adjustments.

            Provides a vastly more customizable work tab. 
            
               &amp;amp;lt;size=24&amp;amp;gt;Important&amp;amp;lt;/size&amp;amp;gt;
                  Work Tab completely takes over job priorities from the vanilla game. In order to support core functionalities and other mods, it intercepts calls to get/set priorities. However, when it is told to set priorities by other modded code that is not aware of the time schedule or detailed priorities, the priority will be set for the whole day, and/or for all workgivers in a worktype.

                                    Work types can be expanded (by Ctrl+clicking the column header) to allow you to set priorities for the individual tasks within each work type. 
                                       Time scheduler to set priorities for a given time slot only - allowing you to designate a cleaning hour, or have your cook prepare meals right before dinner, etc. etc.

The default priorities of tasks within a job is set for a good reason; it’s (usually) a sensible default. Changing these can lead to deadlock situations, so change the priorities of individual jobs at your own risk!

Due to the way the AI is handled (e.g. pawns actively look for work, instead of there being a ‘bulletin board’ of jobs that need doing), it’s not feasible to get the complete list of work that needs doing that would be needed to make this a reality, without extreme overhead and loads of special exception coding.

            Even More Food Filters brings you handy, irreplaceable filters to the Foods category to help you custom-tailor your food restrictions and storages.
            	
               Bringing Awful, Simple, Fine, and Lavish to the Meals category, you can be sure of the meal quality you're targeting.
                  Raw Foods now has a Raw tasty category, so you can be sure your pawns are only eating what they won't complain about when rations get low.
                     Lastly, a Gluttonous category, for all the foods (and a few drugs) that are pleasing to eat, just in case you can't remember.
                        
                           Load low, but no known mods are required to be loaded before this one.

            Ever find it odd that so few people out in the Rim have figured out even the simplest of prosthetics? Ever think pirates and raiders would try to enhance their army with bionics just like you? Ever ponder why your colonists never start with so much as an artificial heart from their life before crashing landing?
            	
               So did we! Now, almost every pawn from every faction on your Rimworld has an increased chance of spawning with a tech-level appropriate prosthetic limb, implant, or bionic body part, ranging from peg legs to power claws. 
                  	
                     No longer does your colony hold the monopoly on bionics!

            Just a simple retexture of all vanilla hair, making them higher resolution for a cleaner result and making the style more consistent and in places just less fugly.

            You think you know what the stat "Plant Harvest Yield" does? Well, let me surprise you - it does NOT increase the amount you get when you harvest plants, like "Mining Yield" does for ores.
            
               It merely gives you a chance to fail below 100%, above 100% you do not gain anything.
                  
                     This changes now! This small C# patch changes the method when harvesting plants so that below 100% nothing changes (you still have a chance to fail, but get 100% of the amount IF you succeed) - but above 100% you get more from the plant. If you have 177% plant harvest yield and the plant usually gives 10 berries, then you now get 17 or 18 (random).
                        
                           Important: This mod removes the max values from all "yield" stats. This includes: MiningYield, AnimalGatherYield, PlantHarvestYield, ButcheryFleshEfficiency and ButcheryMechanoidEfficiency. Meaning those stats can now be more than 100%. If you don't wish this for any of these stats, go into HarvestYieldPatch/Patches/HarvestYieldXMLPatch.xml and remove the defNames of the stats you don't want edited.

            Changes texture of gravel, soil and rich soil to include patches of green and be more distinctive.
